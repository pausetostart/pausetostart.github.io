				<h4>Forest Batheing - Have you tried it?</h4>
				<p> Forest Bathing is a powerful antidote to the pressures of the modern world, proven to deliver lasting benefits to your physical and mental wellbeing, and creating within you a profound connection to nature. On a Forest Bathing experience, our fully qualified Forest Therapy Guides lead you through a series of activities that use the healing powers of the forest to help you re-balance your mind and body.</p>
				<p>Originating in Japan - you may have seen it called shinrin yoku - Forest Bathing is an accepted part of Japanese preventative health care because of the mental, physical and spiritual health benefits it delivers. Also known as forest therapy, it draws on thousands of years of intuitive knowledge - we are part of nature and we have a deep need to feel that connection.</p>

				<p>But does it work? Forest Bathing has been around as a concept in Japan since the early 1980's and scientists there continue to conduct a large amount of research into its benefits, concluding that it deserves its place in the Japanese health-care system. More general research into the area of nature connections suggests that the real and long-term benefits include, among other things, reduced stress, improved immunity, lower blood pressure and accelerated recovery from illness or trauma.</p>

				<h4>What is meditation?</h4>
				<p> Meditation is relaxation. It is not about concentration, it’s actually about de-concentration. It’s not about focussing one’s thoughts on one thing, but instead on becoming thoughtless. </p>
				
				<br>

				<h4>What are the benefits of meditation?</h4>
				<ul>
				<li>A calm mind</li>
				<li>Good concentration</li>
				<li>Better clarity</li>
				<li>Improved communication</li>
				<li>Relaxation & Rejuvenation of the mind and body</li>
				</ul>

				<br>
				
				<h4>6 Health benefits of meditation</h4>
				<p>With meditation, the physiology undergoes a change and every cell in the body is filled with more prana (energy). This results in joy, peace, enthusiasm as the level of prana in the body increases.</p>

				<p>On a physical level, meditation:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Lowers high blood pressure</li>
					<li>Lowers the levels of blood lactate, reducing anxiety attacks</li>
					<li>Decreases any tension-related pain, such as, tension headaches, ulcers, insomnia, muscle and joint problems</li>
					<li>Increases serotonin production that improves mood and behavior</li>
					<li>Improves the immune system</li>
					<li>Increases the energy level, as you gain an inner source of energy</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>11 Mental Benefits of Meditation</h4>
				<p>Meditation brings the brainwave pattern into an alpha state that promotes healing. The mind becomes fresh, delicate and beautiful. It cleanses and nourishes you from within and calms you, whenever you feel overwhelmed, unstable, or emotionally shut down.</p>
				<p>With regular practice of meditation:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Anxiety decreases</li>
					<li>Emotional stability improves</li>
					<li>Creativity increases</li>
					<li>Happiness increases</li>
					<li>Intuition develops</li>
					<li>Gain clarity and peace of mind</li>
					<li>Problems become smaller</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Meditation sharpens the mind by gaining focus and expands through relaxation. A sharp mind without expansion causes tension, anger and frustration. An expanded consciousness without sharpness can lead to lack of action/progress. The balance of a sharp mind and an expanded consciousness brings perfection. Meditation makes you aware - that your inner attitude determines your happiness. </p>

				<p><b> With all these benefits of meditation, why not try it today?</b></p>
